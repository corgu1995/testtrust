//
// The "trivial-assertion" smell (informational).
//
// A test that DOES assert something, but whose every assertion is a single
// weak/vacuous matcher carrying almost no information, is barely better than a
// test with no assertions at all. The canonical shapes:
//
//     it("works", () => { expect(thing).toBeDefined(); });
//     it("runs",  () => { expect(() => run()).not.toThrow(); });
//     it("ok",    () => { expect(x).toBeTruthy(); expect(y).toBeDefined(); });
//
// Each of these passes for an enormous equivalence class of buggy values: a
// wrong-but-defined object, any truthy value, anything that merely didn't
// throw. None pins a concrete value or shape, so the test gives a false sense
// of coverage.
//
// What we flag (AC1): a leaf `it`/`test` whose body HAS at least one assertion
// AND every assertion is one of the recognised weak matchers
// (`toBeDefined` / `toBeTruthy` / `toBeFalsy`, or a negated `toThrow` —
// i.e. `.not.toThrow()`), with NO concrete value/shape assertion anywhere in
// the body.
//
// We deliberately do NOT count `toBeUndefined` / `toBeNull` / `toBeNaN` as
// trivial: each pins an EXACT expected value (only undefined / null / NaN
// passes), so they are precise assertions of a real contract — flagging them
// was a false positive. A lone `expect(x).toBeUndefined()` is therefore CLEAN.
//
// What we DO NOT flag:
//   * Tests with a concrete assertion alongside a weak one (AC2) — e.g. a body
//     that also calls `toEqual` / `toBe(literal)` / `toHaveBeenCalledWith` /
//     `toMatchObject` / a `node:assert` method / a bare `assert(...)`. The mere
//     presence of one non-trivial assertion clears the test.
//   * Assertion-FREE tests — those are the assertion-free detector's concern,
//     not ours. We require at least one real assertion before we say anything.
//   * Anything we cannot positively classify as trivial. If even one assertion
//     in the body is something other than our small whitelist (including a
//     matcher we could not resolve, or a positive bare `toThrow()`), we stay
//     silent. PRECISION FIRST — a false positive mutes the whole tool.
//
// Severity (AC3): "info" by default. This is advisory: the scorer weights it
// lightly and `info` never forces a "fail" verdict on its own. A user may raise
// it via the rules flag (severityOverride), but we never escalate ourselves.
//
// We rely exclusively on the shared, never-throwing helpers `getTestBlocks`,
// `getAssertions`, `getLine`, `getPosition` and `getLineSnippet` — we never
// re-traverse the AST by hand.

/**
 * The information-POOR matchers we consider near-vacuous. These assert only
 * "something is here" (`toBeDefined`) or a coarse truthiness bucket
 * (`toBeTruthy` / `toBeFalsy`) — whole equivalence classes of buggy values
 * satisfy them, so they pin no concrete content.
 *
 * Deliberately EXCLUDED (these are PRECISE, not trivial): `toBeUndefined`,
 * `toBeNull`, `toBeNaN`. Each of those pins an EXACT expected value — only
 * `undefined` / `null` / `NaN` respectively passes — so a test whose only
 * assertion is one of them is asserting a real, specific contract (e.g.
 * `expect(info.remote.address).toBeUndefined()` pins "no header => undefined").
 * Lumping them in with the weak matchers produced launch-credibility-tanking
 * false positives, so they are NOT members of this set.
 *
 * Negation does not rescue a member: `not.toBeDefined()` is existence-level just
 * like `toBeDefined`, so it still counts as trivial regardless of `.not`. (Note
 * the parser reports the matcher NAME as `toBeDefined` with `negated: true`, so
 * `not.toBeDefined()` matches here while a literal `toBeUndefined()` does not.)
