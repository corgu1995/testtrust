// src/report/json.ts
// The JSON reporter. Serializes a Report into the canonical, machine-readable
// JSON artifact that CI stores and downstream tooling parses.
//
// CONTRACT: pure and deterministic. Given the same Report it ALWAYS returns the
// byte-identical string — no Date, no IO, no randomness, no input mutation. This
// is what lets the JSON output be committed/diffed as a stable CI artifact.
//
// We do NOT trust the key order of the incoming objects. JSON.stringify emits
// keys in their own-enumeration order, so two Reports that are deeply equal but
// were assembled with different field orders would otherwise serialize to
// different bytes. To guarantee stability we rebuild every level as a fresh
// plain object with an EXPLICIT, fixed key order and stringify that.
//
// Key omission: optional Finding fields that are `undefined` are dropped
// entirely rather than emitted as `null`, so consumers can use plain
// `"column" in finding` / `?.` checks. (JSON.stringify already drops `undefined`
// object members, but we also avoid inserting the key at all so intent is
// explicit and it is never accidentally turned into `null`.)
